   - Users can choose their preferred chain for transactions, considering factors such as gas fees and transaction speed.

7. Wallet Integration:
   - Integration with MetaMask SDK to enable secure wallet management for users.
   - Users can connect their MetaMask wallets to the application for seamless transaction processing.

8. Payment and Escrow Release:
   - Clients can make payments to the escrow using cryptocurrency (e.g., Ether) or stablecoins (e.g., DAI).
