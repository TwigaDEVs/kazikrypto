## Architecture

This project consists of a Solidity smart contract and a React frontend application that interacts with it via MetaMask.
#### Smart Contract overview
 Deployed smart contract infura link : 
https://explorer.goerli.linea.build/address/0x2C0Bf8f9014cAFbC9dC56b524D9069CE505414Ae

The smart contract is written in Solidity and contains the core logic and state of the application. It is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Main functions:
- `addNewFreelancer()` - Allows adding a new freelancer profile  

- `editFreelancerProfile()` - Updates freelancer profile information

- `setProfileVisibility()` - Sets freelancer profile visibility

- `getFreelancer()` - Gets a freelancer's profile

- `addPortfolio()` - Adds project samples to a freelancer's portfolio

- `getPortfolio()` - Gets a freelancer's portfolio item

- `addFreelancerExperience()` - Adds work experience to a freelancer's profile 

- `getExperience()` - Gets a freelancer's experience item

- `postAClientJob()` - Allows a client to post a new job

- `getClientJob()` - Gets all posted client jobs  

- `makeABidding()` - Allows freelancers to bid on a posted job

- `getBid()` - Gets a single bid on a job

- `getBids()` - Gets all bids for a job

- `chat()` - Initiates a chat between freelancer and client

- `markAsRead()` - Marks chat messages from sender as read

- `getChat()` - Gets chat messages

- `getChats()` - Gets all chats with a user

- `acceptBid()` - Client accepts a freelancer's bid on their job 

- `addProjectMilestone()` - Adds a milestone to an accepted bid

- `approveProjectMilestone()` - Approves milestone completion and pays freelancer

- `getFreelancerMileStones()` - Gets a freelancer's milestones  

- `getProjectMileStones()` - Gets milestones for a project

- `getFreelancerTransactions()` - Gets a freelancer's transactions

- `rateAfreelancer()` - Rates a freelancer after job completion

- `viewFreelancerRating()` - Views a freelancer's ratings

- `createDispute()` - Creates a dispute between freelancer and client

- `markDisputeAsResolved()` - Resolves an open dispute

- `getDispute()` - Gets a dispute details

- `getAllDisputes()` - Gets all open disputes
The contract uses events like ValueSet and ValueChanged to emit notifications when state changes.

#### Frontend Overview


The frontend React app provides the user interface and interacts with the deployed smart contract.
- deployed frontend ui  [web app link](https://kazikrypto.vercel.app/)

#### Key Functions

The frontend UI is built using React and provides forms and views to interact with the smart contract functions:

- Calls contract functions like `addNewFreelancer()` by sending Ethereum transactions using `web3.js` or `ethers.js` libraries.
- For transactions, prompts user to sign using their `MetaMask wallet `.
- Reads data by calling functions like `getFreelancer()` and `getBids()` using call methods.
- Listens for events like `BidAccepted` to update UI instantly.
- Shows transaction history, portfolio etc by querying contract mappings.
- Updates state by calling functions like `editFreelancerProfile()` after taking user input.

#### Connecting to Blockchain

The app connects to the user's Ethereum wallet (MetaMask) to get their account address.
#### Managing State
React hooks are used to manage state and UI logic.
#### Summary

The React frontend provides the UI components and interacts with the Solidity smart contract on Ethereum blockchain to deliver the full decentralized application experience.

#### Testing

    truffle is used to deploy and test the Solidity contracts locally during development.
    react-testing-library for testing components with DOM.

Overall, this architecture allows creating a decentralized app using React for the frontend and Solidity for the core blockchain logic. `MetaMask` and `Infura` provide easy blockchain interactions.

## Security Considerations

...
Security was an important consideration in the design of the KaziKrypto smart contract:

- Access control is implemented using modifiers like onlyOwner to restrict privileged functions.
- Sensitive state-changing functions perform appropriate validity checks on inputs and contract state before executing.
- Funds from job posters are held in escrow by the contract until job completion to avoid misuse.
- Job applicants bid for jobs by depositing funds to prevent spamming fake bids.
- Payments are released in milestones agreed upon by both parties to ensure satisfactory progress.
- Disputes can be raised and arbitrated by the contract owner for resolution in cases of conflicts.
- Code is thoroughly commented for readability and logic flow.
- Testing with tools like truffle provides ongoing guardrails during development.
- External security audit of the contract code will be done prior to mainnet deployment.
- A bug bounty program is planned to encourage ethical hacking of the smart contract on testnets.
- Critical bug fixes and improvements will be issued via a formal upgrade and migration process for users.

Adhering to security best practices through the design, implementation, testing and deployment phases is essential for a robust decentralized application.

## Performance and Scalability
The KaziKrypto smart contract is designed to be performant and scalable:

- Data structures like arrays and mappings are used for efficient storage and lookup. For example, allClientJobs array tracks all jobs.
- Most functions have a time complexity of O(1) for reading data by directly accessing mappings. - This allows the contract to scale as data grows.
For iterating over arrays like getting all bids for a job, the complexity is O(n) where n is the number of bids. This can be optimized further with pagination.
- Writing data on blockchain like posting jobs or bidding is more complex and costs gas. So the critical transactional functions use appropriate events to update the frontend UI without needing to read data each time.
- Computationally intensive functions are avoided in the contract. Code is optimized to reduce gas costs.
- To allow scaling the number of users and transactions, the contract data can be migrated to a Layer 2 rollup while still leveraging the security of Ethereum Mainnet.
In the future, using an indexing protocol like The Graph can enable near real-time querying of contract data from the frontend.

Overall, the contract is designed to be efficient and scalable while balancing cost and performance tradeoffs. As adoption increases, further optimizations like data sharding can help scale access.
